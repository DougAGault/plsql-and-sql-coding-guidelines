# Insum PL/SQL &amp; SQL Coding Guidelines

## Introduction

In 2019, Rich Soule of Insum forked these guidelines from the Trivadis guidlines and changed most of the rules to comply with Insum coding standards and added many new guidelines. New rules were also suggested in the Trivadis Issues, and while many were adopted, some (and some we consider very important) were not.

Trivadis published their guidelines for PL/SQL &amp; SQL in 2009 in the context of the DOAG conference in Nuremberg. Since then these guidelines have been continuously extended and improved. Now they are managed as a set of markdown files. This makes the the guidelines more adaptable for individual application needs and simplifies the continous improvement.
