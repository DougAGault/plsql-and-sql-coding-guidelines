# About

We all stand in the shoulders of giants. Many people have participated in the creation and refinement of these guidelines. Without the efforts from Roger Troller, JÃ¶rn Kulessa, Daniela Reiner, Richard Bushnell, Andreas Flubacher, Thomas Mauch, and Philipp Salvisberg, this guidelines document wouldn't be what it is today.

The Oracle Database Developer community is made stronger by resources freely shared by experts around the world, such as the Trivadis Coding Guidelines. If you have not yet adopted standards for writing SQL and PL/SQL in your applications, this is a great place to start.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
